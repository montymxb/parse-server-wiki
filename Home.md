Parse Server is a new project, separate from the hosted Parse API service.  Our intention is to provide and support the growth of an open-source API server, and allow new developers to benefit from the powerful Parse client SDKs regardless of where their application logic and data is stored.

Parse Server can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server works with the Express web application framework. It can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself. See the [list of prerequisites](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Parse-Server-Guide#prerequisites).

### Documentation

See the [Parse Server Guide](/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Parse-Server-Guide) to learn more about using Parse Server in your project.

### Migrating to Parse Server from hosted Parse

The hosted version of Parse will be fully retired on January 28th, 2017. Migrate your existing Parse apps to your own Parse Server by following the [migration guide](https://parse.com/migration).

### Development

See the [Development Guide](/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Development-Guide) to learn more about developing for Parse Server.
